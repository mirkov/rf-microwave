#+title: Transmission line calculations

* Aim

  A collection of formulas for analysis and design of impedance linex,
  cavities, waveguides and antennas.


  The package is rather incomplete at this point, and I will augment
  it as the need arises

* Description

  Because of overlap in symbols, the library is structured as a
  collection of packages.  Their hierarchy is as follows:
  - General packages
    - ~constants.rfmw~
    - ~material-props.rfmw~
  - Transmission line packages
    - ~general.transmission-lines~
    - ~coaxial.transmission-lines~
    - ~micro-strip.transmission-lines~
  - Waveguides
    - ~general.waveguides~
    - ~rectangular.waveguides~



  The ~micro-strip-transmission-lines~ (nickname ~mstl~) package
  contains formulas the micro-strip lines obtained from the following

* Definitions
  - z-0 :: characteristic impedance
  - z-t :: normalized impedance
  - L/h :: Inductance/unit-length
  - C/h :: capacitance/unit-length
  - beta :: 2pi/lambda
  - lambda :: wavelength
  - l :: length
  - gamma :: reflection coefficient
